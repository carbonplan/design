# CarbonPlan Design

This site documents our design system.

The core elements were developed with [Ordinary Things](https://ot.studio) in Spring 2020. We revamped the system in Spring 2021, and we are continuing to evolve it. (They are amazing, by the way. Definitely talk to them about your next project.)

Most components of the system can be used from our open source javascript packages [@carbonplan/theme](https://github.com/carbonplan/theme), [@carbonplan/components](https://github.com/carbonplan/components), and [@carbonplan/icons](https://github.com/carbonplan/icons). You can use this site to explore the system through live code examples. This website and its [source code](https://github.com/carbonplan/design) are good examples of how everything works under the hood.
