# Emoji

We used stylized dot emojis for fun and a bit of humor. They are available in the [`@carbonplan/emoji`](https://github.com/carbonplan/emoji) package.

```jsx live
<PoopSad />
```

For example usage, see our `Custom404` component.

export default ({children}) => <Section name='emoji'>{children}</Section>
